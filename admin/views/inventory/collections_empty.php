	<h3>What are collections?</h3>
	
	<p>Collections are very similar to categories with the main difference being that you can organise products into sets and organise them in the order you want customers to see them.</p>
	
	<p>Examples could be the perfect BBQ, Mother's Day gifts, Father's Day gifts, Winter specials, etc.</p>
	
	<p>Collections can be turned off and on whenever you like.</p>
