		<h1>Help your customers find the products that interest them as fast as possible with our filters module</h1>
		
		<p>When confronted with a category containing 100 products spread across multiple pages most customers will simply throw in the towel. But, give them the option to filter by what interests them, whether it's price, colour or any other aspect, and you can show your customers exactly what they want and raise conversions.</p>
