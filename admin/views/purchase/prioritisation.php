		<h1>Sorry, you don't have the prioritisation module installed.</h1>
		
		<p>With this module installed you can re-organise products within your store's categories* to help promote your products better.</p>
		
		<p>Let's say, for example, you wanted to move your best selling shower which appears 34th in the Electric Showers category up to 4th. Using this feature, you can simply <strong>drag and drop</strong> the item to position 4 - it's as easy as that!</p>
